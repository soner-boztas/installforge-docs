# Making a Donation

> InstallForge has been available completely free of charge for over 15 years and has been continuously developed since
its first release in 2007 until today. Our mission is still to offer developers a free alternative to distributing their
own software applications. The development of InstallForge is entirely based on the financial support of its users.
Therefore we ask everyone who loves our software as much as we do to support the development with a donation. Thanks! :octicons-heart-fill-24:

â€“ _Soner Boztas_, founder & lead software engineer of InstallForge

As a thank you, we will gladly link your private page or the page of your company on the InstallForge homepage. Just
leave us a note when you donate if you wish to do so.
