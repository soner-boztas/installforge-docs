# Reporting a Bug

We set high standards for ourselves and always strive to deliver high quality to InstallForge users. However, no
software application on the scale of InstallForge is free from defects. If you think you have found a bug, please 
report it in our [public user forums](https://installforge.net/forums/viewforum.php?f=7).
